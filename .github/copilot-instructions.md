# Online Shop with Machine Learning recommendations
This is a training excercise project to build an online shop that uses machine learning to provide personalized product recommendations to users. The project will involve setting up a web application, integrating a machine learning model, and deploying the application for public access. It will not be used in production, but rather as a learning tool to understand the concepts and technologies involved in building such a system. The product catalog will be simulated with sample data, and user interactions will be tracked to train the recommendation model.

# Goals
- Learn how to build a full-stack web application using modern technologies with help of Github Copilot.
- Learn how to create machine learning models for recommendation systems.
- Understand how to integrate machine learning models into a web application.
- Gain experience in deploying web applications to cloud platforms.

# Technologies Used
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, SPA
- Backend: Python, Flask
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Azure Machine Learning studio
- Hosting: Azure App Service, Azure PostgreSQL flexible server
- Deployment: Github Actions, terraform, single environment only
- Containerization: Docker/Podman

# Main features
- Product Catalog: Browse and search for products.
- Product Details: View detailed information about each product.
- Shopping Cart: Add, remove, and view items in the cart.
- User Authentication: Sign up, login, and logout functionality.
- Personalized Recommendations: Machine learning model to suggest products based on user behavior and preferences.

# Way of working
- No need for agile methodologies or sprints, as this is a solo learning project. No stand-ups or retrospectives will be held. No estimations are required.
- Basic project management using a simple task list or kanban board to track progress.
- The backlog will be held in Github Issues and work will be tracked using Github Projects.
- There will be 2 milestones: 
  - Milestone 1: Basic web application with product catalog, product details, shopping cart, and user authentication.
  - Milestone 2: Integration of machine learning model for personalized recommendations and deployment to cloud platform.
- Milestone 1 will be mostly generated with help of Github Copilot, while Milestone 2 will involve mostly manual coding and learning about machine learning. There will be placeholders created by Github Copilot in Milestone 1 for the machine learning integration to be filled in later.

# Assumptions
- The application will be built for educational purposes and will not handle real transactions.
- User data will be simulated for the purpose of training the recommendation model.
- The focus will be on learning and experimentation rather than performance optimization or scalability.

# Out of scope
- Payment Gateway Integration: No real payment processing will be implemented.
- Advanced Security Measures: Basic security practices will be followed, but advanced measures like multi-factor authentication will not be implemented.
- Scalability: The application will be designed for learning purposes and may not handle high traffic loads
- Mobile Optimization: The application will be primarily designed for desktop use, with limited mobile responsiveness.
- Extensive Testing: Basic testing will be performed, but comprehensive test coverage will not be a priority
- Multi-environment Deployment: Only a single deployment environment will be set up, without separate staging or production environments.
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Basic deployment automation will be set up, but advanced CI/CD pipelines will not be implemented.
- Advanced Machine Learning Techniques: The focus will be on basic recommendation algorithms without delving into complex deep learning or neural networks.
- Third-party Integrations: No integration with external services or APIs beyond the core functionalities.
- No documentation will be created beyond basic code comments and README files.
- Observability: No logging, monitoring, or alerting systems will be implemented.
